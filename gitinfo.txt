-to check git installed or not
   git version

-make your folder a repository
   git init

   git add file_name(to send file to stagging area)
   git status
   git commit(msg along is typed)
   press I to write in vim editor
   to exit vim press escape and type :wq (this means write and quit)
     
-to tell the user file_name
   git config --global user.name "[first name last name]"
   git config --global user.email "[mailid]"

-another way to commit out without using vim editor
   git commit -m "adding file1.txt"

-to see the chnages made by one other can see by command 
   git log

-if you want to make 3 version but by modifying file1.txt only
that is file and file1 with extra code making third
then we have to use add command again to make third version

-now if we want to go again on version one
we shoul move the head pointing to verson 3


 -git checkout e732ac15c6d3570dc89e404b88fa8acb5bddd901 adress of version
 it will delete the other and give only 1


 -if want to move at latest
  git checkout  master
